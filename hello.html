  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
  </p>

  <p class="more-text">There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two pages will take on a lighter color than the first &mdash; the &quot;class&quot; attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags will take care of that.
  </p>

  <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as the `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
  </p>
